# Crime Analysis in Toronto and Vancouver (2020–2024)

## Overview
This project is a comparative analysis of crime patterns between **Toronto** and **Vancouver** over the years 2020 to 2024. Using real-world open datasets, we explored crime types, seasonal trends, time-of-day variations, and the relationship between socioeconomic factors (like income and education) and crime rates.

This was my **first successful project** in the field of **Data Analysis**, completed as part of **CS2545 (Data Analytics for Big Data)**.

## Project Goals
- Analyze crime trends across two major Canadian cities.
- Identify common and uncommon crime types.
- Explore seasonal and hourly crime trends.
- Study the impact of socioeconomic factors on crime rates.
- Create meaningful visualizations to support findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- **NumPy** — Numerical Analysis
- **Matplotlib** — Data Visualization
- **ThinkStats** — Statistical Analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Development Environment

## Datasets
- **Toronto Police Open Data** (2020–2024)
- **Vancouver Open Data Portal** (2020–2024)
- **Socioeconomic profiles** (external government sources)

## Key Facts
- Total Crimes (2020–2024):
  - Toronto: **200,097** incidents
  - Vancouver: **174,480** incidents
- **Property Crime** was most common in Vancouver.
- **Violent Crime** (especially assault) was most common in Toronto.
- **Summer** was the peak crime season for both cities.
- Peak crime hours:
  - Vancouver: **12 AM (midnight)**
  - Toronto: **5 AM** (data needs validation)
- Outside locations, apartments, and commercial properties were major hotspots.

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and wrangling: Handling missing and inconsistent data.
- Comparative analysis of crime types.
- Seasonal and hourly trend analysis.
- Crime counts by property type (Toronto only).
- Regional crime "hotspot" mapping.
- Socioeconomic factor integration (manual research).
- Visualization: Bar Charts, Line Graphs, Histograms, CDFs.

## Challenges Faced
- Missing socioeconomic data in crime datasets.
- Time formatting issues.
- No "property type" data for Vancouver.
- Large datasets requiring careful cleaning and filtering.

## Results
- **Toronto** has higher violent crime rates.
- **Vancouver** has higher property crime rates.
- **Outside areas** like streets and parks are highly vulnerable.
- **Higher income and education levels** tend to correlate with **lower crime rates**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can uncover meaningful insights into urban crime patterns. It also emphasizes the role of socioeconomic factors in shaping public safety. Improving income and education levels can significantly contribute to lowering crime rates.
